**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Got comfortable "cold calling" students by name to answer questions when nobody wanted to raise their hand.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I made good use of teacher feedback to ask questions in "negative" (i.e. "did anyone not...") to put pressure on students to answer the question and keep the lesson moving.
- (Possible improvement from teacher) When questioning, if students are struggling then either cut it short and tell them the answer or provide a hint.

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Point 3 of Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management.
- (Possible improvement from teacher) A student didn't know the answer to my question, try to check back in a few minutes later to check if they can now answer it.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I circulated the room to check if students were completing the coding exercises correctly, which demonstrates proactive classroom management.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I moved onto "independent" practice at an appropriate time for students to complete coding exercises, which reflects effective time management.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I dealt well with a large code snippet not working for students by debugging their attempts and working with students to look for issues in their code.
- (Possible improvement from teacher) Start keeping track of the time so I can pace the lesson properly.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Broke down the below code to make the lesson interactive by getting the students to write this code out with hints and no immediate answer.
```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, genre, director, year) VALUES
('Inception', 'Sci-Fi', 'Christopher Nolan', 2010 ),
('The Avengers', 'Action', 'Joss Whedon', 2012 ),
('Mean Girls', 'Comedy', 'Mark Waters', 2004 ),
('The Dark Knight', 'Action', 'Christopher Nolan', 2008 ),
('Pulp Fiction', 'Crime', 'Quentin Tarantino', 1994 );
```

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Questions asked were factual and on previous content taught. 
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Started off the lesson with recap questions, dedicating 20% of the lesson to recap questions and the rest to new content.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I asked questions on the code provided (below) after getting the students to type it out. This made for a good combination of introducing unfamiliar code without it being blind copying.
```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
title TEXT NOT NULL,
genre TEXT NOT NULL,
director TEXT NOT NULL,
year INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I noticed students were re-writing the below line of code to insert multiple records into a database and showed that it's not necessary as multiple records can be passed in one statement. This shows my ability to identify areas students might need clarification.
```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, genre, director, year) VALUES
``` 

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Keep track of the time to pace the lesson better and realise when to stop the session.
- When questioning students that are struggling, either tell them the answer or give a hint. 
- After a student didn't know the answer to my question, check back a few minutes later.
