**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Make questions that have clear answers
- Keep an eye on lesson time remaining
- Create & conduct coding challenges lesson

**Action points acted on**
- Created coding challenges with hints & completion checklist. Conducted the lesson
- Asked clear questions naturally
- Kept an eye on lesson time throughout

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - Special Project coding challenges

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Very natural and clear questions about the API structure and CRUD (refer to all questions in booklet_3).
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I justified well why the `rating` column in the `movies` table doesn't need `NOT NULL` unlike the rest of the columns, leading to a deeper understanding of how the API should work. 

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I circulated the room as students were completing challenges and supported them through mistakes well with good questioning.
- (Possible improvement from teacher) For the first challenge, I should have made an example of amending one endpoint (as there were three to change) so students could be more supported.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- Point 1 of Initiative and Creativity.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Independently created a set of coding challenges with an appropriate level of challenge for students to complete. 
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) When students were completing a challenge, I correctly noticed a potential problem that many students would be making (wrong data type in SQL - Integer not Real - Challenge 1 in booklet_3) and set them on the correct path.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Structured a table-fill exercise well, especially by ensuring one row was filled out for students as an example (refer to table in booklet_3).

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Provide a few example solutions for small parts in big, multi-part questions.
- When creating coding challenges, provide more hints.
- Leave enough time in the lesson to go through solutions to attempted coding challenges.

(Achievements and Progress) With reference to the Learning Criteria outlined in section 5.2 of your Handbook, give examples of actions you have taken that demonstrate achievement or progress in each area. Describe the methods or techniques used (with reasoning), along with evidence of success or need for improvement.
