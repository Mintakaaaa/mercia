**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Complete the CRUD lessons
- Annotations for booklets
- Help students who struggle to answer questions more

**Action points acted on**
- CRUD lessons completed
- (failed to) Give annotations for students to make 
- Helped students answer harder questions

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good questions about the code (e.g. why do we delete a record by the PK).
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I "translated" unfamiliar code to English to help a student through a question (`if genre is not None:`)
- (Possible improvement from teacher) Some of my questions were vague and sometimes hard to find what answer I was looking for.

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I had a good distribution of questions to different students - this time all students got to answer lots of questions.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement) Debugged errors in students' code and kept the lesson flowing at a steady pace.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Created on-the-spot questions about the code to challenge students.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I told an interesting story about how my classmate and I worked on an IoT device to implement auto-fetching firmware updates from a web server and linked this to the HTTP status codes found when retrieving the firmware. I made the connection between what is being learnt (HTTP status codes) to a vastly different area of CS. I made the point that all of these concepts I'm teaching students are linked.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Started off the lesson with appropriate amount of recap questions, I didn't go all the way back to the beginning knowledge, just recapped last lesson because the students have the basics down.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Gave the students a task appropriate to their level and current knowledge (lines 1-2 given, rest is done by students):
```python
if title is not None:
	update_data["title"] = title
if genre is not None:
	update_data["genre"] = genre
if director is not None:
	update_data["director"] = director
if year is not None:
	update_data["year"] = year
```

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Some of my questions were vague and sometimes hard to find what answer I was looking for
- I should remember to give students some annotations to make on important facts.
- Manage lesson time better (keep an eye on time more!!!)

(Achievements and Progress) With reference to the Learning Criteria outlined in section 5.2 of your Handbook, give examples of actions you have taken that demonstrate achievement or progress in each area. Describe the methods or techniques used (with reasoning), along with evidence of success or need for improvement.
