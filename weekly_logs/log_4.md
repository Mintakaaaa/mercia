**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Keep track of lesson time so I can pace myself
- When questioning students that are struggling, either tell them the answer or give a hint
- After a student didn't know the answer to my question, check back a few minutes later

**Action points acted on**
- Kept track of time and finished lesson on time
- Asked follow-up questions to check understanding
- Gave hints to question answers and cut questions short when necessary

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Correctly gave up on asking a question about SQLAlchemy when students didn't have the answer even after a hint.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good use of relatable phrases and good explanations of code, i.e. "This reads in English as..." The code in question: `id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)`
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I told a story about my own A-Level NEA Python program and my own pitfalls with SQL at the time. This helped students link their own learning to the real world and helped them see me more as a "real person" than a robot teacher.

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Supported a student through a question when they got it mostly correct - student named 4/5 DB table columns, forgot the ID column.  
- (Possible improvement from teacher) When asking for a multi-part answer, try to split the answer up and ask each student for an answer, e.g. what are the 5 columns of this table (each student answers one column).
- (Possible improvement from teacher) Asking too many 'can anyone tell me' questions - it is better to ask targeted questions at specific students (this is how it is done in Mercia School). **Use the phrase "I'll accept hands up for this question".**

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement) I Kept track of time and finished the lesson on time.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- Point 1 of Understanding the Educational Needs of Others.
- Point 2 of Understanding the Educational Needs of Others.
- Point 3 of Understanding the Educational Needs of Others.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Started off the lesson with recap questions, good combination of questions and explanations.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Created a good follow-up question for a student to push them further after they didn't answer well enough.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good task design as exemplified by this code:
  `title = Column(String)`
  `genre = Column(String)`
  `director = Column(String)`
  `year = Column(String)`
  The level of challenge was appropriate and allowed modelling and correction to take place as part of task, rather than subsequently.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Linked the concepts I am teaching the students to real-world applications and professional work. 
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I realised right before asking, that it wouldn't be the right thing to do to question the students' knowledge before giving initial explanation of this code: `genre: Optional[str] = None`
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Linked the code `query = query.filter(Movie.genre == genre)` to the `WHERE` clause in `SQL`, which incorporates students' previous knowledge.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Ask *targeted* questions at specific students.
- When asking for a multi-part answer, ask **each** student for one part of the answer.
- **Stop forgetting to check the time!!!** This week I barely finished the lesson on time. It's an improvement - but still needs work.
