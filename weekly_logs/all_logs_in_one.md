**Tutoring context & session content**

A One-hour “lecture” style lesson for Y12 students that introduced the concept of APIs, a motivation behind building APIs, an app demonstration of varied levels of complexity, and initial questions about APIs.  

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Progress) on speaking in a clear and audible manner, whilst managing nervousness – I could have performed better here.
- (Achievement) asked a small number of questions to students to gauge understanding of tiny parts of demo app code.
- (Progress) on explaining abstract concepts like APIs – I could have done this better.
---
**Working with Others**
- (Achievement) successfully collaborated with a teacher at the beginning of the lesson to set up the demo app (and solved some quick problems during setup like the platform Replit not installing packages correctly), ready for demonstration and my “lecture”.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- See Initiative and Creativity

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) created the demo app before the next meeting and showed it to the teacher to discuss points of interest.
- (Achievement) drew an impromptu diagram of how an API interacts with a database, and a user.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement) recommended an API resource called Firebase Auth and had a very short discussion about Google's APIs with a student at the end of the lesson.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- (Teacher feedback) Ask more questions.
- (Teacher feedback) Have a list of points I will address in the lesson.
- Rehearse the lesson plan more to remember to address key points, which I forgot/missed.
- I keep circling back in different ways when explaining something, this can confuse students.

**Date** 
28/02/25

**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Ask more questions
- Have a list of things you want to say before the lesson
- Create a thorough programming lesson plan

**Action points acted on**
- I asked more questions
- I prepared a list of things I was going to say
- Recapped last visit's API info and executed the lesson plan

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Really clear explanations of taught concepts, I added detail rather than repeating what's on the lesson plan handout.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I told a *story* which built interest and/or tension in the lesson. I strategically added steps into the lesson plan that ensured students would encounter things not working as expected with the intention of highlighting the steps required to get their Python project running. This allowed me to add further explanations of what is going on and keep the students engaged.
- (Progress & Possible Improvement from Teacher) Even if the answer to the question is written down, I should still ask for the answer. This still gets the attention of students.
- (Big Achievement & teacher feedback) At the end of a large section of explanations and coding, I stopped and summarised the knowledge imparted onto the students. 

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good awareness of the room when everyone was done completing a task given by me. I gave the students enough time to finish a task and moved on promptly.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good work getting around helping individuals. I helped 2 students debug a code error after they tried to implement the example I gave them, which kept the lesson going smoothly.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement) Point 1 of **Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Point 2 of **Working with Others**
- (Progress & Possible improvement from teacher) Use **less** time to collect my thoughts for explanations as we are not only giving knowledge but also *coaching* the students in such a way that preserves the pace of the lesson.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Successfully created an initial sketch of lesson plan which was moderated by the teacher and improved by me after adding my own insights, information, lesson recap, and question ideas.
- (Achievement) Asked on-the-spot questions that were not in the initial lesson plan.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Progress **{Inclusivity}** & Possible Improvement from Teacher) Give knowledge and then test instead of testing and confirming knowledge after. This gives students from non-privileged backgrounds who aren't as knowledgeable as those from a middle-class background a better chance to understand and not fall behind.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good understanding of when the knowledge given was essential and when it was nice to know. I explained how specific Python project network configurations (ports) aren't essential to know whilst the imported frameworks are.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Make the lesson more interactive (next part of learning is SQL database population - so I discussed with the teacher the plan to introduce interactivity through a worked example, letting the students complete the next step, correcting it, and letting them complete the rest).
- Give knowledge, then test - I tested before giving knowledge.
- Ask questions in *negative* - e.g. "Who **hasn't** finished setting this up?" instead of "Who **has** finished setting this up?" - This gives more pressure on students to respond and keeps the lesson going.
- Ask **MORE** questions! Have a list of 5-10 questions for the second lesson written at specific locations on the plan.

**Date** 
06/03/25

**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Make lessons more interactive and less like a lecture
- Ask even **more** questions!
- Ask questions in *negative*

**Action points acted on**
- Amend next lesson's plan to add interactivity
- Create and ask recap questions
- Change the way I ask questions

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Got comfortable "cold calling" students by name to answer questions when nobody wanted to raise their hand.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I made good use of teacher feedback to ask questions in "negative" (i.e. "did anyone not...") to put pressure on students to answer the question and keep the lesson moving.
- (Possible improvement from teacher) When questioning, if students are struggling then either cut it short and tell them the answer or provide a hint.

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Point 3 of Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management.
- (Possible improvement from teacher) A student didn't know the answer to my question, try to check back in a few minutes later to check if they can now answer it.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I circulated the room to check if students were completing the coding exercises correctly, which demonstrates proactive classroom management.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I moved onto "independent" practice at an appropriate time for students to complete coding exercises, which reflects effective time management.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I dealt well with a large code snippet not working for students by debugging their attempts and working with students to look for issues in their code.
- (Possible improvement from teacher) Start keeping track of the time so I can pace the lesson properly.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Broke down the below code to make the lesson interactive by getting the students to write this code out with hints and no immediate answer.
```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, genre, director, year) VALUES
('Inception', 'Sci-Fi', 'Christopher Nolan', 2010 ),
('The Avengers', 'Action', 'Joss Whedon', 2012 ),
('Mean Girls', 'Comedy', 'Mark Waters', 2004 ),
('The Dark Knight', 'Action', 'Christopher Nolan', 2008 ),
('Pulp Fiction', 'Crime', 'Quentin Tarantino', 1994 );
```

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Questions asked were factual and on previous content taught. 
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Started off the lesson with recap questions, dedicating 20% of the lesson to recap questions and the rest to new content.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I asked questions on the code provided (below) after getting the students to type it out. This made for a good combination of introducing unfamiliar code without it being blind copying.
```sql
CREATE TABLE movies (
id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
title TEXT NOT NULL,
genre TEXT NOT NULL,
director TEXT NOT NULL,
year INTEGER NOT NULL
);
```
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I noticed students were re-writing the below line of code to insert multiple records into a database and showed that it's not necessary as multiple records can be passed in one statement. This shows my ability to identify areas students might need clarification.
```sql
INSERT INTO movies (title, genre, director, year) VALUES
``` 

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Keep track of the time to pace the lesson better and realise when to stop the session.
- When questioning students that are struggling, either tell them the answer or give a hint. 
- After a student didn't know the answer to my question, check back a few minutes later.

- After a student didn't know the answer to my question, check back a few minutes later

**Action points acted on**
- Kept track of time and finished lesson on time
- Asked follow-up questions to check understanding
- Gave hints to question answers and cut questions short when necessary

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Correctly gave up on asking a question about SQLAlchemy when students didn't have the answer even after a hint.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good use of relatable phrases and good explanations of code, i.e. "This reads in English as..." The code in question: `id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)`
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I told a story about my own A-Level NEA Python program and my own pitfalls with SQL at the time. This helped students link their own learning to the real world and helped them see me more as a "real person" than a robot teacher.

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Supported a student through a question when they got it mostly correct - student named 4/5 DB table columns, forgot the ID column.  
- (Possible improvement from teacher) When asking for a multi-part answer, try to split the answer up and ask each student for an answer, e.g. what are the 5 columns of this table (each student answers one column).
- (Possible improvement from teacher) Asking too many 'can anyone tell me' questions - it is better to ask targeted questions at specific students (this is how it is done in Mercia School). **Use the phrase "I'll accept hands up for this question".**

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement) I Kept track of time and finished the lesson on time.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- Point 1 of Understanding the Educational Needs of Others.
- Point 2 of Understanding the Educational Needs of Others.
- Point 3 of Understanding the Educational Needs of Others.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Started off the lesson with recap questions, good combination of questions and explanations.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Created a good follow-up question for a student to push them further after they didn't answer well enough.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good task design as exemplified by this code:
  `title = Column(String)`
  `genre = Column(String)`
  `director = Column(String)`
  `year = Column(String)`
  The level of challenge was appropriate and allowed modelling and correction to take place as part of task, rather than subsequently.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Linked the concepts I am teaching the students to real-world applications and professional work. 
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I realised right before asking, that it wouldn't be the right thing to do to question the students' knowledge before giving initial explanation of this code: `genre: Optional[str] = None`
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Linked the code `query = query.filter(Movie.genre == genre)` to the `WHERE` clause in `SQL`, which incorporates students' previous knowledge.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Ask *targeted* questions at specific students.
- When asking for a multi-part answer, ask **each** student for one part of the answer.
- **Stop forgetting to check the time!!!** This week I barely finished the lesson on time. It's an improvement - but still needs work.

**Date** 
20/03/25

**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Use the phrase "I'll accept hands up for this (question)"
- Create a booklet for the next few lessons
- When asking a question with multiple answers, split it up so more students can answer.

**Action points acted on**
- I used the phrase "I'll accept hands up for this" a lot
- I created a booklet for the next few lessons
- I split up a multi-part question up, and gave many students opportunities to answer questions.

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I did some "cold-calling" as well as hands up questioning.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I kept saying: 'I'm going to keep asking this.' It was good that I said that repeatedly because it makes it clear I'm putting across important information.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I asked great questions like "which SQL clause does the `filter()` function act as?"
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I did not move on after one answer to a question about a 'rich concept' but did the right thing and got multiple answers for comparisons. I'm really proud of this because it displays strong questioning improvements.

*Rich concept: a concept with multiple valid perspectives or layers of understanding, allowing for richer discussion, the question I asked was: "how does each CRUD operation relate to Netflix?" which can be found in Booklet 2.*

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I turned recap information into many questions and split them up over multiple students (every student got the opportunity to answer questions). I am especially happy about this because this is a great example of my effort to introduce inclusivity.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) My use of student names was very good this lesson, which demonstrates my attempt to build inclusivity and engagement in the classroom. 

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I pre-warned students about knowledge that was going to be tested very soon which gave time for students to mentally prepare to answer questions. This mixed up the questioning style and paused the "cold-calling" and sudden questions.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I structured information in Booklet 2 very well especially everything under the heading **CRUD in FastAPI** in Booklet 2, especially because it would aid in memorisation for future testing.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Showing the students how to use FastAPI's auto-generated documentation was a great idea because it helped them understand the project better. This was in response to not being able to use standard tools like Postman for API testing, so I had to improvise...
- (Achievement) I created a new booklet for the next few lessons for students to follow along with. This was done completely independently by me, instead of collaborating with the teacher. I still got the green-light to go through with it though before the lesson.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Recap information and questions were good particularly in this lesson due to the fact I am only teaching weekly.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I am getting a "high rate of success" (students are answering my questions correctly a lot) which means my questions are well pitched and clear. My questioning is improving rapidly!
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I got students to do independent work after being supported through examples which was the right thing to do when introducing independent work.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) After asking how to name an endpoint function, a student said `def add_movie`, I suggested to rename the function to link it to CRUD more strongly, the student said `def create_movie` which is what I was looking for. This linked the function directly to CRUD. This especially shows the ability to connect new learning to foundational concepts.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Whilst talking about something, I can get the students to add annotations on their copy of the booklet to reinforce some information I deem important.
- I stopped what I was talking about when I noticed a student with their hand up. Teacher informed me I can finish making my points before answering a student's question.
- When I question a student and they struggle, I should try to loop back to them after a few minutes to reinforce their learning. I should do this by adding a tick-mark or a cross for questions that were answered correctly or struggled on.

**Action points acted on**
- CRUD lessons completed
- (failed to) Give annotations for students to make 
- Helped students answer harder questions

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good questions about the code (e.g. why do we delete a record by the PK).
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I "translated" unfamiliar code to English to help a student through a question (`if genre is not None:`)
- (Possible improvement from teacher) Some of my questions were vague and sometimes hard to find what answer I was looking for.

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I had a good distribution of questions to different students - this time all students got to answer lots of questions.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement) Debugged errors in students' code and kept the lesson flowing at a steady pace.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Created on-the-spot questions about the code to challenge students.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I told an interesting story about how my classmate and I worked on an IoT device to implement auto-fetching firmware updates from a web server and linked this to the HTTP status codes found when retrieving the firmware. I made the connection between what is being learnt (HTTP status codes) to a vastly different area of CS. I made the point that all of these concepts I'm teaching students are linked.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Started off the lesson with appropriate amount of recap questions, I didn't go all the way back to the beginning knowledge, just recapped last lesson because the students have the basics down.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Gave the students a task appropriate to their level and current knowledge (lines 1-2 given, rest is done by students):
```python
if title is not None:
	update_data["title"] = title
if genre is not None:
	update_data["genre"] = genre
if director is not None:
	update_data["director"] = director
if year is not None:
	update_data["year"] = year
```

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Some of my questions were vague and sometimes hard to find what answer I was looking for
- I should remember to give students some annotations to make on important facts.
- Manage lesson time better (keep an eye on time more!!!)

**Action points acted on**
- Created coding challenges with hints & completion checklist. Conducted the lesson
- Asked clear questions naturally
- Kept an eye on lesson time throughout

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - Special Project coding challenges

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Very natural and clear questions about the API structure and CRUD (refer to all questions in booklet_3).
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I justified well why the `rating` column in the `movies` table doesn't need `NOT NULL` unlike the rest of the columns, leading to a deeper understanding of how the API should work. 

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I circulated the room as students were completing challenges and supported them through mistakes well with good questioning.
- (Possible improvement from teacher) For the first challenge, I should have made an example of amending one endpoint (as there were three to change) so students could be more supported.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- Point 1 of Initiative and Creativity.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Independently created a set of coding challenges with an appropriate level of challenge for students to complete. 
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) When students were completing a challenge, I correctly noticed a potential problem that many students would be making (wrong data type in SQL - Integer not Real - Challenge 1 in booklet_3) and set them on the correct path.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Structured a table-fill exercise well, especially by ensuring one row was filled out for students as an example (refer to table in booklet_3).

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Provide a few example solutions for small parts in big, multi-part questions.
- When creating coding challenges, provide more hints.
- Leave enough time in the lesson to go through solutions to attempted coding challenges.

**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Provide a few example solutions for small parts in big, multi-part questions
- Provide more hints for coding challenges
- Leave enough time in the lesson to go through solutions to attempted coding challenges

**Action points acted on**
- Completed rest of the coding challenges (excl. one due to time constraints + this is the last visit) + concluded API building lessons & special project.
- Provided example solutions for small parts of big questions (to catch slow students up)
- Left enough time in lesson to go through solutions to full coding challenges

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - Special Project coding challenges

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Really good circulation of the room and conversations/questioning to help solve coding problems when students get stuck without just telling them the answer (I responded in such a way that gets them to think on the right track and ponder **towards** the correct answer)

**Working with Others**
- (Possible improvement from teacher) When explaining a solution to the first coding challenge of the day, I said "if you're done with this then you don't need to listen to the explanation - just carry on." - teacher said this can work but the students can miss important explanations and clarifications AND they can **think** they got it right but in reality they might not - this is dangerous. So in the same lesson I applied that and got good results.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Possible improvement from teacher) I should have started the previous coding challenges lesson with the second challenge instead of the first one because it was more appropriate difficulty level-wise.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Created a good questionnaire for results gathering for the special project - got the green-light from the teacher to give to students. Will be filled out 1 day hopefully after this visit.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- Point 1 of Communication - this takes **lots of understanding** of educational needs of **each** student as everyone is different *(skill level, their current mental image of the coding problem, the discrepancy between their code and the solution and how to bridge that without giving the answer and more...)*
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good clarification of which files students should be editing (during coding challenges with many files to edit) - this saves hard-to-revert errors! 
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I made the choice to break down my challenge solution explanation into 2 parts, preventing students from struggling to understand **what** has gone wrong (e.g. the SQL or Python)
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) For Challenge 4 I correctly clarified the `watched` column should be typed out as `false` or `true` **all in lowercase** when entering fields in SQL because it is knowledge they might not have and isn't crucial to know exact SQL syntax (memorisation) when the challenge is about problem-solving and critical thinking.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Make sure students listen to the explanations of solutions despite them knowing the answer
- Make sure you bring spare booklets!
- Farewell Mr Jennings, it's been really nice working with you! 🥹
