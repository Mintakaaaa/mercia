**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Use the phrase "I'll accept hands up for this (question)"
- Create a booklet for the next few lessons
- When asking a question with multiple answers, split it up so more students can answer.

**Action points acted on**
- I used the phrase "I'll accept hands up for this" a lot
- I created a booklet for the next few lessons
- I split up a multi-part question up, and gave many students opportunities to answer questions.

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I did some "cold-calling" as well as hands up questioning.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I kept saying: 'I'm going to keep asking this.' It was good that I said that repeatedly because it makes it clear I'm putting across important information.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I asked great questions like "which SQL clause does the `filter()` function act as?"
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I did not move on after one answer to a question about a 'rich concept' but did the right thing and got multiple answers for comparisons. I'm really proud of this because it displays strong questioning improvements.

*Rich concept: a concept with multiple valid perspectives or layers of understanding, allowing for richer discussion, the question I asked was: "how does each CRUD operation relate to Netflix?" which can be found in Booklet 2.*

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I turned recap information into many questions and split them up over multiple students (every student got the opportunity to answer questions). I am especially happy about this because this is a great example of my effort to introduce inclusivity.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) My use of student names was very good this lesson, which demonstrates my attempt to build inclusivity and engagement in the classroom. 

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I pre-warned students about knowledge that was going to be tested very soon which gave time for students to mentally prepare to answer questions. This mixed up the questioning style and paused the "cold-calling" and sudden questions.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I structured information in Booklet 2 very well especially everything under the heading **CRUD in FastAPI** in Booklet 2, especially because it would aid in memorisation for future testing.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Showing the students how to use FastAPI's auto-generated documentation was a great idea because it helped them understand the project better. This was in response to not being able to use standard tools like Postman for API testing, so I had to improvise...
- (Achievement) I created a new booklet for the next few lessons for students to follow along with. This was done completely independently by me, instead of collaborating with the teacher. I still got the green-light to go through with it though before the lesson.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Recap information and questions were good particularly in this lesson due to the fact I am only teaching weekly.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I am getting a "high rate of success" (students are answering my questions correctly a lot) which means my questions are well pitched and clear. My questioning is improving rapidly!
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I got students to do independent work after being supported through examples which was the right thing to do when introducing independent work.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) After asking how to name an endpoint function, a student said `def add_movie`, I suggested to rename the function to link it to CRUD more strongly, the student said `def create_movie` which is what I was looking for. This linked the function directly to CRUD. This especially shows the ability to connect new learning to foundational concepts.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Whilst talking about something, I can get the students to add annotations on their copy of the booklet to reinforce some information I deem important.
- I stopped what I was talking about when I noticed a student with their hand up. Teacher informed me I can finish making my points before answering a student's question.
- When I question a student and they struggle, I should try to loop back to them after a few minutes to reinforce their learning. I should do this by adding a tick-mark or a cross for questions that were answered correctly or struggled on.
