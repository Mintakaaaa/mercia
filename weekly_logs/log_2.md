**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Ask more questions
- Have a list of things you want to say before the lesson
- Create a thorough programming lesson plan

**Action points acted on**
- I asked more questions
- I prepared a list of things I was going to say
- Recapped last visit's API info and executed the lesson plan

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - direct programming lesson

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Really clear explanations of taught concepts, I added detail rather than repeating what's on the lesson plan handout.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I told a *story* which built interest and/or tension in the lesson. I strategically added steps into the lesson plan that ensured students would encounter things not working as expected with the intention of highlighting the steps required to get their Python project running. This allowed me to add further explanations of what is going on and keep the students engaged.
- (Progress & Possible Improvement from Teacher) Even if the answer to the question is written down, I should still ask for the answer. This still gets the attention of students.
- (Big Achievement & teacher feedback) At the end of a large section of explanations and coding, I stopped and summarised the knowledge imparted onto the students. 

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good awareness of the room when everyone was done completing a task given by me. I gave the students enough time to finish a task and moved on promptly.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good work getting around helping individuals. I helped 2 students debug a code error after they tried to implement the example I gave them, which kept the lesson going smoothly.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Achievement) Point 1 of **Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Point 2 of **Working with Others**
- (Progress & Possible improvement from teacher) Use **less** time to collect my thoughts for explanations as we are not only giving knowledge but also *coaching* the students in such a way that preserves the pace of the lesson.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Successfully created an initial sketch of lesson plan which was moderated by the teacher and improved by me after adding my own insights, information, lesson recap, and question ideas.
- (Achievement) Asked on-the-spot questions that were not in the initial lesson plan.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Progress **{Inclusivity}** & Possible Improvement from Teacher) Give knowledge and then test instead of testing and confirming knowledge after. This gives students from non-privileged backgrounds who aren't as knowledgeable as those from a middle-class background a better chance to understand and not fall behind.
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good understanding of when the knowledge given was essential and when it was nice to know. I explained how specific Python project network configurations (ports) aren't essential to know whilst the imported frameworks are.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Make the lesson more interactive (next part of learning is SQL database population - so I discussed with the teacher the plan to introduce interactivity through a worked example, letting the students complete the next step, correcting it, and letting them complete the rest).
- Give knowledge, then test - I tested before giving knowledge.
- Ask questions in *negative* - e.g. "Who **hasn't** finished setting this up?" instead of "Who **has** finished setting this up?" - This gives more pressure on students to respond and keeps the lesson going.
- Ask **MORE** questions! Have a list of 5-10 questions for the second lesson written at specific locations on the plan.

(Achievements and Progress) With reference to the Learning Criteria outlined in section 5.2 of your Handbook, give examples of actions you have taken that demonstrate achievement or progress in each area. Describe the methods or techniques used (with reasoning), along with evidence of success or need for improvement.
