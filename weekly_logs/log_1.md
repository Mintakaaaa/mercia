**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Progress) on speaking in a clear and audible manner, whilst managing nervousness – I could have performed better here.
- (Achievement) asked a small number of questions to students to gauge understanding of tiny parts of demo app code.
- (Progress) on explaining abstract concepts like APIs – I could have done this better.

**Working with Others**
- (Achievement) successfully collaborated with a teacher at the beginning of the lesson to set up the demo app (and solved some quick problems during setup like the platform Replit not installing packages correctly), ready for demonstration and my “lecture”.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- See Initiative and Creativity

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) created the demo app before the next meeting and showed it to the teacher to discuss points of interest.
- (Achievement) drew an impromptu diagram of how an API interacts with a database, and a user.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- (Achievement) recommended an API resource called Firebase Auth and had a very short discussion about Google's APIs with a student at the end of the lesson.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- (Teacher feedback) Ask more questions.
- (Teacher feedback) Have a list of points I will address in the lesson.
- Rehearse the lesson plan more to remember to address key points, which I forgot/missed.
- I keep circling back in different ways when explaining something, this can confuse students.
