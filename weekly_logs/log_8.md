**Action points identified from previous visit**
- Provide a few example solutions for small parts in big, multi-part questions
- Provide more hints for coding challenges
- Leave enough time in the lesson to go through solutions to attempted coding challenges

**Action points acted on**
- Completed rest of the coding challenges (excl. one due to time constraints + this is the last visit) + concluded API building lessons & special project.
- Provided example solutions for small parts of big questions (to catch slow students up)
- Left enough time in lesson to go through solutions to full coding challenges

**Tutoring context & session content**
6 Year 12 students - Special Project coding challenges

**Achievement and Progress**

**Communication**
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Really good circulation of the room and conversations/questioning to help solve coding problems when students get stuck without just telling them the answer (I responded in such a way that gets them to think on the right track and ponder **towards** the correct answer)

**Working with Others**
- (Possible improvement from teacher) When explaining a solution to the first coding challenge of the day, I said "if you're done with this then you don't need to listen to the explanation - just carry on." - teacher said this can work but the students can miss important explanations and clarifications AND they can **think** they got it right but in reality they might not - this is dangerous. So in the same lesson I applied that and got good results.

**Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management**
- (Possible improvement from teacher) I should have started the previous coding challenges lesson with the second challenge instead of the first one because it was more appropriate difficulty level-wise.

**Initiative and Creativity**
- (Achievement) Created a good questionnaire for results gathering for the special project - got the green-light from the teacher to give to students. Will be filled out 1 day hopefully after this visit.

**Understanding the Educational Needs of Others**
- Point 1 of Communication - this takes **lots of understanding** of educational needs of **each** student as everyone is different *(skill level, their current mental image of the coding problem, the discrepancy between their code and the solution and how to bridge that without giving the answer and more...)*
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) Good clarification of which files students should be editing (during coding challenges with many files to edit) - this saves hard-to-revert errors! 
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) I made the choice to break down my challenge solution explanation into 2 parts, preventing students from struggling to understand **what** has gone wrong (e.g. the SQL or Python)
- (Achievement & teacher feedback) For Challenge 4 I correctly clarified the `watched` column should be typed out as `false` or `true` **all in lowercase** when entering fields in SQL because it is knowledge they might not have and isn't crucial to know exact SQL syntax (memorisation) when the challenge is about problem-solving and critical thinking.

**Critical Self-Evaluation points to identify three specific improvements I can make in the future**
- Make sure students listen to the explanations of solutions despite them knowing the answer
- Make sure you bring spare booklets!
- Farewell Mr Jennings, it's been really nice working with you! ðŸ¥¹

(Achievements and Progress) With reference to the Learning Criteria outlined in section 5.2 of your Handbook, give examples of actions you have taken that demonstrate achievement or progress in each area. Describe the methods or techniques used (with reasoning), along with evidence of success or need for improvement.
