**Lesson/tutoring context**

A Year 12 class of 6 pupils with mixed Python abilities completed two lessons. One about Python dictionaries and one about SQL.

**Observation method**
Watching from rear of class and analysing past written materials used in class.

**Observations**  
*(Make sure you include references to specific competence shown by the teacher, using the learning criteria 5.2 of your Handbook. Include examples in which you think the teacher managed a situation particularly well or badly, and how pupils responded to different actions.)*

**(Communication Skills)** The teacher displayed really good communication skills by explaining the written material effectively and providing context to it. I.e. a “Python dictionary has some elements in it, and the first element has index of 0. (here’s the context) Indexing is used throughout Python in concepts including arrays and dictionaries.”

**(Working with Others)** The teacher also worked well with students by considering and accepting their suggestions to fix some unexpectedly broken code during a live, impromptu demonstration and explained why their suggestions work or don’t work. The teacher did not belittle the student for providing a bad/failing solution, but instead praised them for speaking up.

**(Communication Skills)** Upon failure to explain a concept to the students, the teacher took a step back and re-explained that concept in a slightly different way and did not double-down on the confusing method of explanation.

**(Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management, Initiative and Creativity)** The teacher was very organised and well-prepared for the lesson with a set of written materials that included some explanations to code snippets along with tasks for students to complete on their own after delivering the necessary concepts. The teacher also provided the students with impromptu extension tasks in case the students grasped the ideas very effectively.

**(Communication Skills)** The teacher spoke clearly, expressively with hand motions, without stuttering or going back and forth between ideas. When adding context to ideas, the teacher did not deviate from the main concept enough to confuse the students. The lesson delivery was direct.

**Analysis and conclusions**  
*(Comment on what you feel you have learned from your observations, with particular reference to Communication Skills and Working with Others.)*

**(Communication Skills)** I learnt that teaching concepts to students should be direct and straightforward. Juggling multiple ideas especially when explaining the basics will confuse students. Therefore, the way you deliver content to student matters a lot, you should be expressive to engage the students; you can achieve this by moving your hands, mixing up your intonation and volume levels, etc.

**(Working with Others)** I learnt that the students voice matters regarding offering solutions to unexpected problems like broken code. It can give an insight into how the student is thinking about the problem and whether they understand the concept they are learning about.

**(Communication Skills, Working with Others)** I learnt that when students do not understand your explanations when teaching is normal. In this case you should provide a different way to explain this concept instead of repeating the same method multiple times. This not only saves time but also students’ frustration.

**(Organisation, Reliability and Self-Management, Initiative and Creativity)** I learnt that having prepared a set of written materials not only helps you stay on track in the lesson, but also allows you to create extension tasks for students to complete in case they are ahead of others and have nothing left to do. Written materials also reduce the chance of the teacher making mistakes when teaching and helps them stay organised.

**Identify three specific features you think you can transfer to your own tutoring**  
1. I can prepare written materials that I can hand out to the students and explain in-lesson. 
2. I can speak directly and clearly with differing intonation and volume levels to keep the students engaged and not confused.  
3. I can come up with extension or impromptu tasks or examples to challenge students when they understand the lesson very well.
